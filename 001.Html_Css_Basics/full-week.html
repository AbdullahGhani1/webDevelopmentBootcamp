      My first goal is to learn HTML and CSS within one week. To achieve this, I
      will dedicate at least four hours each day to studying and practicing
      these languages. I plan to gain a solid understanding of the syntax,
      properties, and best practices for HTML and CSS. With this knowledge, I
      will be able to create well-structured and visually appealing web pages.
    </p>
    <p class="upcomming-goals">
      Once I feel comfortable with HTML and CSS, my next goal is to learn
      JavaScript and TypeScript. While these languages are more complex than
      HTML and CSS, I am committed to putting in the necessary time and effort
      to become proficient in them. I will focus on learning the fundamental
      concepts and syntax of JavaScript and TypeScript, as well as the latest
      best practices and coding patterns.
    </p>
    <p class="upcomming-goals">
      My final goal is to learn React Js, a powerful JavaScript framework for
      building user interfaces. I am excited about the possibilities that this
      technology can offer and I am determined to learn it to a high level of
      proficiency. I plan to start with the basics of React, such as component
      creation and state management, and then progress to more advanced topics
      like Hooks and Redux. With this knowledge, I will be able to build dynamic
      and interactive web applications that provide a seamless user experience.
